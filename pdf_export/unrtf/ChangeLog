0.21.1:
      - fixed strings in unicode_to_string() (unicode.c) to be null
	terminated instead of newline terminated.  This prevents spurious
	newline output after characters in Symbol font.  It also overcomes a
	fault whereby characters in the symbol font were being output as
	unicode instead of the desired entities defined in the output
	specification.
      - suppressed output of <font face="Symbol"> as this is wrong if
	characters are changed to unicode or entities
      - changed path set with -P to be directory containing the output
	charmaps specifications, and changed the default path to
	/usr/local/lib/unrtf for the same reason.  This makes it possible
	to set a different default path, useful for example if one cannot
	install files in /usr/local/lib.
      - dropped "outputs" and "charmaps" sub-directories in the configuration
        directory.  Output configuration files are now named "html.conf",
	"text.conf" etc. and the symbol font charmap file is "SYMBOL.charmap".
      - charmap specifications now sought in the search path
      - compensate for RTF with unicodes specified as negative numbers,
	possibly due to overflow on a 16bit machine?
      - changed processing of --html (etc.) args so that "-t html" and
	"--html" are equivalent, i.e. both subject to search path set with
	"-P"
